ParentingBuddy is an app designed to assist parents in guiding and nurturing their children optimally. Through a variety of features and resources, the app provides targeted support in parenting and child development.



## Features
The app allows for dynamic content customization through the cloud. This includes flexible integration of new timelines, articles, and podcasts on the home screen without the need for app updates. This ensures a continuous supply of fresh podcasts and articles.

Additionally, all information is stored on the device using the Isar database to ensure offline support. This not only enhances user experience but also conserves valuable cloud storage bandwidth. Our app checks the server daily for new content. If new data is available, only the new data is downloaded and integrated into the app. If no new data is available, the app utilizes the stored information.

## What I Have Learned
During the programming phase, we considered transitioning from Firebase to AWS. Consequently, I familiarized myself with Node.js and began creating a custom API for the app. This API included Firebase authentication. However, we realized midway that the additional effort was significant. As a result, we reverted to using Firebase.
